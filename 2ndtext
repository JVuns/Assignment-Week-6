230 This book is a sequel and a reply to a book by Stephen Graham,
231 explorer-poet, and Vernon Hill, artist.
232 
233 I had a splendid six weeks tramping with my lifetime friend, Stephen
234 Graham, in the Rockies. We climbed northwest through Glacier Park,
235 Montana, across the Canadian line into Alberta, Canada. There it is in
236 two sentences.
237 
238 It would take more than the _Encyclopædia Britannica_ to tell on how
239 many points I differ from Stephen, and on how many points I agree with
240 him. I had not the least idea that so much Lindsay was going into
241 Graham’s fireside notes--while I was asleep at noon, often recovering in
242 an hour from ten hours of restless, sleepless freezing by night. I do
243 not hold myself liable in court for any opinions of mine then recorded
244 by Graham. My daytime strength was not all given to thought, however,
245 but often to trying to keep Graham in sight when he was a quarter of a
246 mile ahead of me climbing mountains absolutely perpendicular. As I
247 remember our first fireside discussions, they were as to whether there
248 was actually such a person as Patrick Henry. Graham had an idea he was a
249 perverse invention of my own fancy. But he looked him up afterwards and
250 found there was such a man. As I remember our conversations after that
251 provocation, I kept trying to deliver to him from memory Bryce’s
252 _American Commonwealth_, unabridged, two volumes, one thousand pages
253 each. I remember those volumes well. I read every page in lonely country
254 hotels and on slow local trains while a Sunday field-worker for the
255 Anti-Saloon League. And now invisible leaves of Bryce often made the
256 chief ingredient of our tea. So I have indicated in the design.
257 
258 I did not tell Graham I was quoting the great ambassador, and so many
259 unsupported, heavy and formidable statements he quite properly hesitated
260 to write out, without further confirmation, though he drank them down
261 quite cheerfully. In the great blank spaces in Graham’s narrative where
262 he skips really splendid scenery, I was quoting Bryce--not always
263 singing hymns!
264 
265 The most authentic part of my book, the part Mr. Vernon Hill has left
266 out, is that the mountains were as steep as I have drawn them. His
267 mountains, otherwise quite correct, are not sufficiently perpendicular.
268 Vernon Hill, of course, was not physically with us on the expedition. He
269 was in London, drawing beautiful and famous Arcadian Calendars. When
270 later he came to illustrate Graham’s book in London, with Graham bending
271 over him, no one mentioned the fact that the mountains were all like
272 church steeples. Graham had not noticed it, and it did not occur to
273 Vernon Hill by wireless. Otherwise Vernon Hill was in excellent
274 communication with us, and every picture in Graham’s book expresses
275 exactly what Graham was talking to me about to make me forget the
276 tumbles and the briers, and to drown out the Bryce.
277 
278 After I had hunted for years and years to find an explorer-poet who
279 would take a long walk with me, and had scared every one off by the
280 elaborateness of the proposal, the first troubadour that took me up on
281 it almost broke my neck. It was a grand and awful time. The sensible
282 reviews of Graham’s book have been by Walter Prichard Eaton. He does not
283 discuss Graham’s opinions or mine. But he is very plain about the fact
284 that we almost slid into eternity. He has tried those mountains himself,
285 and he knows. He should write several more reviews.
286 
287 Stephen Graham is a lifetime friend, and I have assembled these drawings
288 as a sign thereof. But because I have been studying Hieroglyphics in the
289 Metropolitan Museum all this summer, and because United States
290 Hieroglyphics of my own invention are haunting me day and night, this
291 book is drawn, and not written. I serve notice on the critics--the
292 verses are most incidental, merely to explain the pictures. And so,
293 directly considered, it is much more a reply to Vernon Hill, the artist,
294 than to Stephen.
295 
296 The artist of the Arcadian Calendar discerned rightly. Graham and I
297 were in Arcady, even if it was a bit rough.
298 
299 Going-To-The-Sun Mountain is the very jewel of the mountains of Glacier
300 Park. All the tourists love it, and they are right. Its name fits it.
301 
302 Going-To-The-Sun Mountain is our American Fujiyama, as all testify who
303 have seen it.
304 
305 Obviously, an ingredient of good tea is talk on Egyptian Hieroglyphics.
306 I had an invisible copy of an Egyptian Grammar with me and I put a leaf
307 from it into every pot of tea. Graham did not take to the taste of it as
308 much as he did to the pages of Bryce, but he was nobly patient, as one
309 may say, with Egypt.
310 
311 The Hieroglyphics in this work are based on two more British-Egyptian
312 grammars he sent me after he reached London. Still, they may be
313 described as United States Hieroglyphics, and almost any Egyptologist
314 will be willing to describe them that way, having about as much to do
315 with Egypt as Egyptian cigarettes. The Egyptians were, briefly, a nation
316 of Vernon Hills, who drew their “Arcadian Calendar” for four thousand
317 years in red and black ink, or cut it in granite. _I keep thinking about
318 them!_ A free translation of the hieroglyphic inscription at the bottom
319 of the first picture following is:
320 
321 +-----------------------------------------------+
322 | _The beating heart of the waterfall of the |
323 | double truth, as it appears to a scribe, |
324 | a servant of Thoth--Thoth, who is god of |
325 | picture-writing, photoplays and hieroglyphics,|
326 | and an intense admirer of waterfalls._ |
327 +-----------------------------------------------+
328 
329 
330 With this start, the reader can go straight through the book without a
331 mistake.
332 
333 Now, a last word as to the seal, _The Elements of Good Tea_.
334 
335 On the southern side of the Canadian-United States boundary, just as we
336 reached it, our coffee gave out. Most symbolical happening! There in the
337 deep woods, as we passed to the northern side, Graham said with a sigh
338 of insatiable anticipation: “Now we will have some tea.” We had had tea
339 all along, alternated with coffee. But now Stephen, on his own heath,
340 was emphatic about it. So he made tea, a whole potful, with a kick like
341 a battering ram, and I drank my half.
342 
343 Certainly the most worth-while thing in Stephen’s book, and mine, is a
344 matter known to all men long before the books were written. That is,
345 that a Britisher and a United Stateser can cross the Canadian-American
346 line together and discover that it is hardly there; can discover that an
347 international boundary can be genuine and eternal and yet friendly. If
348 there is one thing on which Stephen and I will agree till the Judgment
349 Day, it is that all the boundaries in the world should be as open, and
350 as happy, as the Canadian-United States line. To many diplomats such a
351 boundary is incredible, and yet it exists, one of the longest in the
352 world.

359 WE START WEST FOR THE WATERFALLS
360 
361 
362 Tricking us, making our hearts their prey,
363 The dreams of the dreams, with books of the dreams,
364 Haunt the homes of the town this day;
365 The visions of rivers, with rhymes of the waterfalls,
366 Haunt the yards of the town this day;
367 The fairies of the fairies, with the flowers of the fairies,
368 Haunt the factories of the town this day;
369 And we throw them kisses, and they fly away.
370 
371 Tricking us, making our hearts their prey,
372 The angels of the angels, with the flags of the angels,
373 Haunt the clouds above the town this day,
374 And we throw them kisses and they fly away.
375 And they call us west to the glacial mountains,
376 To the mines that are books, to the natural fountains.

383 GOING-TO-THE-SUN
384 
385 
386 The mountain peak called “Going-To-The-Sun,”
387 In Glacier Park,
388 Is the most gorgeous one,
389 And when the sun comes down to it, it glows
390 With emerald and rose.

397 THE MYSTIC ROOSTER OF THE MONTANA SUNRISE
398 
399 
400 On the mountain peak, called “Going-To-The-Sun,”
401 I saw the rooster that no storm can tame,
402 The center of the sun was but his eye,
403 His comb was but the sun rays and the flame.
404 There in the Glacier Park, above white glaciers,
405 There, above Montana and the west,
406 He crowed and called his boast around the world,
407 Emotion shook his red embroidered vest.
408 There is humor in the very biggest rooster,
409 But even more magnificence than fun.
410 I laugh because he acted like a rooster,
411 I am solemn, for he was the biggest one.
412 I like a rooster or a turkey gobbler,
413 I like their forthright impudence at times.
414 They are neither larks, nor trilling nightingales,
415 And yet they always sing in splendid rhymes.
416 When I heard the vast bird of the sunrise crying,
417 The world held not one inch of silly prose.
418 Any rooster is a flowerlike fowl,
419 And this one was a crimson Yankee rose.
420 
421 [Illustration]
422 
423 
424 
425 
426 THE BIRD CALLED “CURIOSITY”
427 
428 
429 Round the mountain peak called “Going-To-The-Sun,”
430 In Glacier Park, a steep and soaring one,
431 Circled a curious bird with pointed nose
432 Who led us on to every cave, and rose
433 And swept through every cloud, then brought us berries,
434 And all the acid gifts the mountain carries,
435 And let us guess which ones were good to eat.
436 And even when we slept his sharp wings beat
437 The weary fire, or shook the tree-top cones,
438 Or rattled dead twigs like a fairy’s bones.
439 The vulgar bird, “Curiosity”! When we
440 Were tired, and lean, and shaking at the knee,
441 We put this bird in harness. He was strong
442 As any ostrich, pulled our packs along,
443 Helped us up over the next annoying wall,
444 And dragged us to the chalet, and the tourists’ resting hall.
445 
446 And when once more we were young, well-fed men,
447 He beat the door to call us forth again.

465 AND THEY LAUGHED
466 
467 
468 By the mountain peak, called “Going-To-The-Sun,”
469 A dizzy mountain, where paths twist round and round
470 And nothing in sober order can be found--
471 I asked the poppies: “What fairies do you see?”
472 And they shook their long stems, and they laughed at me.

487 THE FAIRY CIRCUS
488 
489 
490 A fairy ran a circus
491 With a pigeon puffed and proud,
492 A humble bullfrog
493 And a rather solid cloud.
494 
495 She wore her underwear,
496 The rest wore what they had,
497 The frog wore a blue coat
498 Just like his dad.
499 
500 The pigeon wore his feathers
501 And spread himself--O My!
502 The cloud wore sunshine
503 He gathered in the sky.

510 THE BATTLE-AX OF THE SUN
511 
512 
513 On the mountain peak I reached the drift
514 And I took it for a Christmas gift,
515 And I made ten soldiers out of snow.
516 
517 But the battle-ax of my fairy foe
518 Cut to the ground my men of snow.
519 
520 And who was he, my fairy foe,
521 Who brought my snowy army low?
522 
523 The mountain sun was my fairy foe.

537 And snow-filled Christmas trees abound.

546 THE PHEASANT SPEAKS OF HIS BIRTHDAYS
547 
548 
549 Up the good slope of Going-To-The-Sun,
550 I saw the Pheasant-Of-The-Sunrise fly.
551 Jewels in his feathers, mixed with dew.
552 Dew and jewels made his jeweled eye.
553 He paused to make a sonnet, which he sang,
554 Though nowhere else are pheasants sonneteers.
555 He emphasized with swooping and with skipping,
556 With winkings and intoxicated leers.
557 And how the bushes twinkled as he caroled:
558 
559 “Each morning is another birthday, friend.
560 And I have lived so many happy birthdays!
561 There are gifts with all the suns that here ascend!
562 Each bush, you see, has an unextinguished candle
563 And angel-food, and icing, and candy flowers,
564 And this long vine that climbs from earth to heaven
565 Gives me thoughts, and most erratic powers.
566 I eat its scarlet berries and its frosting.
567 If I choose, it is my present every day.
568 Then I can fly straight up to heaven’s doorstep
569 Following the green line all the way.
570 
571 [Illustration]
572 
573 “And then I tumble like a limber leaf
574 To my nest here, and another year is done
575 Or another thousand years, what does it matter
576 On the mountain peak called ‘Going-To-The-Sun’?”
577 
578 
579 
580 
581 THE MYSTIC UNICORN OF THE MONTANA SUNSET
582 
583 
584 On the mountain peak, called “Going-To-The-Sun,”
585 I saw the Unicorn-No-Storm-Can-Tame.
586 The center of the sun was but his eye,
587 His mane was but the sun rays and the flame.
588 There in that Glacier Park, above green pastures,
589 There above Stephen’s camp fire in the rocks,
590 He foamed and pawed and whinnied round the world,
591 His feathered sides and plumes and bristling locks
592 Seemed but the banners of a great announcement
593 That unicorns were spry as heretofore,
594 That not a camp fire of the world was dead,
595 That dragons lived in them, and thousands more
596 Camp-born, were clawing at the clouds of Asia,
597 Were rising with to-morrow’s dawn for men,
598 Camp-fire dragons, with the ancient unicorn
599 Bringing the Rosicrucian days again.
600 Any unicorn can drive away
601 Any thoughts the grown-up race has spoiled.
602 When I heard the Unicorn-of-Sunset ramping
603 New fancies in my veins bubbled and boiled.
604 
605 [Illustration]
606 
607 Any unicorn is worth his oats,
608 And so we fed him bacon, and we made
609 An extra cup of tea, which he drank.
610 Then he curled up coltwise, and in slumber sank.
611 Dragons sprang up, next day, where he had stayed.
612 They were in Fujiyama silks arrayed,
613 Or spoke of Everest to Stephen. Then began
614 Discussing the strange peak in Darien
615 That poets climb to see the Pacific well.
616 How Stephen climbed it later, I will let him tell.
617 Following the Unicorn-No-Storm-Can-Tame
618 Alone, in tropic woods, is a great game.

622 
623 JOHNNY APPLESEED STILL FURTHER WEST
624 
625 
626 On the mountain peak, called “Going-To-The-Sun,”
627 I saw old Johnny Appleseed once more.
628 He ate an apple, threw away the core.
629 Then turned and smiled and slackly watched it fall
630 Into a crevice of the mountain wall.
631 In an instant there was an apple tree,
632 The roots split up the rocks beneath our feet,
633 And apples rolled down the green mountainside
634 And fairies popped from them, flying and free!
635 
636 [Illustration]
637 
638 And
639 Fairies
640 Came from them.

647 THE APPLE-BARREL OF JOHNNY APPLESEED
648 
649 
650 On the mountain peak, called “Going-To-The-Sun,”
651 I saw gray Johnny Appleseed at prayer
652 Just as the sunset made the old earth fair.
653 Then darkness came; in an instant, like great smoke,
654 The sun fell down as though its great hoops broke
655 And dark rich apples, poured from the dim flame
656 Where the sun set, came rolling toward the peak,
657 A storm of fruit, a mighty cider-reek,
658 The perfume of the orchards of the world,
659 From apple-shadows: red and russet domes
660 That turned to clouds of glory and strange homes
661 Above the mountain tops for cloud-born souls:--
662 Reproofs for men who build the world like moles,
663 Models for men, if they would build the world
664 As Johnny Appleseed would have it done--
665 Praying, and reading the books of Swedenborg
666 On the mountain top called “Going-To-The-Sun.”

673 THE COMET OF GOING-TO-THE-SUN
674 
675 
676 On the mountain peak, called “Going-To-The-Sun,”
677 A comet stopped to drink from a cool spring
678 And like a spirit-harp began to sing
679 To us, then hurried on to reach the sun.
680 We called him “Homer’s soul,” and “Milton’s wing.”
681 The harp-sound stayed, though he went up and on.
682 It turned to thunder, when he had quite gone--
683 And yet was like a soft voice of the sea,
684 And every whispering root and every blade of grass
685 And every tree
686 In the whole world, and brought thoughts of old songs
687 That blind men sang ten thousand years ago,
688 And all the springtime hearts of every nation know.

695 THE BOAT WITH THE KITE STRING AND THE CELESTIAL EYES
696 
697 
698 On the mountain peak, called “Going-To-The-Sun,”
699 I sat alone; while Stephen explored higher,
700 I dragged in sticks and logs and kept our fire.
701 
702 On soft-winged sails of meditation
703 My boat of spiral shells and flowers,
704 And fluffy clouds and twinkling hours,
705 My thought-boat went with the sun all day
706 Over the glaciers, far away.
707 I sat alone, but the chipmunks knew
708 My boat was high, and plain to view.
709 
710 I flew my ship like a kite. The thread
711 Was a cobweb silk, fine and thin,
712 That came from out the palm of my hand.
713 There I saw the ship begin.
714 From the gypsy’s life line thence it came
715 
716 A feather of mist that flew to the dawn,
717 And I felt the spool in my wrist unwind,
718 And I saw the feather on heaven’s lawn,
719 Now a glimmering ship like a lark awake.
720 And the kite string sang, but did not break.
721 
722 [Illustration]
723 
724 It stretched like the string of a violin
725 Played by invisible tides and waves.
726 It sang of Springfield yet to be.
727 It sang of the dead hours in their graves.
728 
729 And of the United States to be,
730 And of all the map stretched out below.
731 And my kite had pansy eyes in its wings,
732 And I saw the states in their bloom and glow
733 Yet a child’s block-map, and nothing more,
734 Flat patterns on a playroom floor.
735 
736 Texas the fort, by the river to the south,
737 Michigan a pheasant with a leaf in its mouth,
738 Illinois an ear of corn, in the shock,
739 Maine a moose-horn, gray as a rock.
740 California a whale, in gilded mail,
741 Montana, a ranch of alfalfa and clover,
742 
743 Montana with its mountain called “Going-To-The-Sun,”
744 An outdoor temple for the singer and the rover,
745 Wyoming a range for a summer lark,
746 With sparkling trails, and its Yellowstone Park,
747 Colorado an Indian tent for the world,
748 Where the smokes of care-free camps are curled,
749 Arizona a mission in the desert for all time,
750 Where the nerves find peace, and thoughts find rhyme,
751 New Mexico a clay pueblo full of dreams,
752 Eldorado in its valleys, ghosts by its streams.
753 Utah a throne for a grandeur unknown,
754 For haughty hearts, with ways of their own.
755 Nevada the cabin of Mark Twain in his youth,
756 Where he mined in the cañons, where he dug for the truth.
757 Washington a western soldier’s tent,
758 Idaho a chair for a president,
759 North and South Dakota, one buffalo hide,
760 Oregon a lumber mill on a mountain side,
761 Nebraska, Oklahoma, cowboy pistols pointing west
762 Kansas a wheat field where I, once, was a guest,
763 Iowa a corn pone sizzling hot,
764 Minnesota a farmer’s coffee-pot.
765 Arkansas a steamboat at Mark Twain’s door,
766 Missouri Mark Twain’s raft on the shore.
767 Louisiana a cavalier’s boot, just the thing
768 When we wade toward the mouth of the delta in the spring.
769 Mississippi a cotton scales,
770 Alabama many cotton bales,
771 Georgia a peach-basket red,
772 Florida a wild turkey’s head,
773 North Carolina a crane, flying through a cloud,
774 South Carolina a soldier, with head unbowed,
775 West Virginia, the raccoon, shrewd and slow,
776 Tennessee Bob Taylor’s fiddle and bow,
777 Virginia Thomas Jefferson’s mountain and shroud,
778 Kentucky the log cradle of the proud.
779 Maryland a plow, Delaware a pruning hook,
780 Indiana Riley’s Hoosier book,
781 Wisconsin a caldron, cool it who can,
782 Ohio Johnny Appleseed’s park for man.
783 Vermont a poet’s house, with waterfall and fern,
784 Where Frost writes songs that the world will learn.
785 
786 New Jersey the doorstep of the nation,
787 Pennsylvania the front room of the nation,
788 Where once Penn welcomed all creation
789 And let them sleep on the grassy floor
790 And let them eat the wild berries and explore.
791 Rhode Island, Roger Williams’ holy place,
792 Connecticut, an arbor of innocence and grace
793 Filled with flowers, and souls like lace,
794 Especially one little girl six years young
795 Who tells me stories in the fairy tongue.
796 
797 New Hampshire the mast of the Mayflower,
798 Massachusetts the prow of the Mayflower,
799 Most famous ark forevermore.
800 
801 The whole map a temple, if we patiently read,
802 With the statue of Liberty in majesty to plead
803 For Arcady to come once more,
804 And with New York on guard,
805 New York a sentinel,
806 New York a lion by the door.
807 
808 By my camp fire I grew older,
809 There were chipmunks on my shoulder,
810 While I saw the world,
811 With the eyes of my boat,
812 As one land,
813 With Asia and Alaska by the ice bound as one,
814 The Aurora Borealis was a cross bright as the sun.
815 I seemed to live through myriad days.
816 My eyes looked down like searching rays.
817 I took my flight over many races,
818 I saw, in my thought, all human faces.
819 And my spirit had its fill.
820 And the thread in my wrist wound in again
821 The cobweb shortened, strand on strand,
822 And my little ship came back to land
823 And was only a feather in my hand.
824 
825

828 SO MUCH THE WORSE FOR BOSTON

833 _Some words about singing this song,

835 
836 I read the aspens like a book, and every leaf was signed,
837 And I climbed above the aspen-grove to read what I could find
838 On Mount Clinton, Colorado, I met a mountain-cat.
839 I will call him “Andrew Jackson,” and I mean no harm by that.
840 He was growling, and devouring a terrific mountain-rat.
841 But when the feast was ended, the mountain-cat was kind,
842 And showed a pretty smile, and spoke his mind.
843 “I am dreaming of old Boston,” he said, and wiped his jaws.
844 
845 [Illustration: THE BIG EARED RAT OF BOSTON]
846 
847 “I have often HEARD of Boston,” and he folded in his paws,
848 “Boston, Massachusetts, a mountain bold and great.
849 I will tell you all about it, if you care to curl and wait.
850 
851 [Sidenote:
852 
853 _If I cannot sing in the aspens’ tongue,
854 If I know not what they say,
855 Then I have never gone to school,
856 And have wasted all my day._]
857 
858 “In the Boston of my beauty-sleep, when storm-flowers are in bloom,
859 When storm-lilies and storm-thistles and storm-roses are in bloom,
860 The faithful cats go creeping through the catnip-ferns,
861 _And_ rainbows, _and_ sunshine, _and_ gloom,
862 And pounce upon the Boston Mice, that tremble underneath the flowers,
863 And pounce upon the big-eared rats, and drag them to the tomb.
864 For we are Tom-policemen, vigilant and sure.
865 We keep the Back Bay ditches and potato cellars pure.
866 Apples are not bitten into, cheese is let alone.

873 [Sidenote:

875 _Come, let us whisper of men and beasts
876 And joke as the aspens do,
877 And yet be solemn in their way,

880 In the morning,
881 In the frost,
882 And in the midnight dew._]
883 
884 Sweet corn is left upon the cob, and the beef left on the bone.
885 Every Sunday morning, the Pilgrims give us codfish balls,
886 Because we keep the poisonous rats from the Boston halls.”
887 And then I contradicted him, in a manner firm and flat.
888 “I have never seen, in the famous Hub, suppression of the rat.”
889 “So much the worse for Boston,” said the whiskery mountain-cat.
890 
891 And the cat continued his great dream, closing one shrewd eye:
892 “The Tower-of-Babel Cactus blazes above the sky.
893 Fangs and sabers guard the buds and crimson fruits on high.
894 Yet cactus-eating eagles and black hawks hum through the air.
895 When the pigeons weep in Copley Square, look up, those wings are there,

903 _The mountain-cat seems violent,
904 And of no good intent.
905 Yet read his words so gently
906 No bird will leave its tree,
907 No child will hate the simper or the noise
908 And hurry away from you and me.
909 Read like a meditative, catlike willow-tree._]

911 [Sidenote:

913 _Some words about singing this song,

915 
916 Proud Yankee birds of prey, overshadowing the land,
917 Screaming to younger Yankees of the self-same brand,
918 Whose talk is like the American flag, snapping on the summit-pole,
919 Sky-rocket and star-spangled words, round sunflower words,
920 they use them whole.
921 There are no tailors in command, men seem like trees in honest leaves.
922 Their clothes are but their bark and hide, and sod and binding
923 for their sheaves.
924 Men are as the shocks of corn, as natural as alfalfa fields.
925 And no one yields to purse or badge; only to sweating manhood yields,
926 To natural authority, to wisdom straight from the new sun.
927 Who is the bull-god of the herd? The strongest and the shaggiest one.
928 Or if they preen at all, they preen with Walter Raleigh’s
929 gracious pride:--
930 The forest-ranger! One grand show! With gun and spade slung at his side!
931 Up on the dizzy timber-line, arbiter of life and fate,
932 Where sacred frost shines all the year, and freezing bee
933 and mossflower mate.

942 Speaking grandly to that larger flower
943 That grows down toward the sea, hour after hour
944 Hunting for the Pacific storms and caves._]
945 
946 “Boston is tough country, and the ranger rides with death,
947 Plunges to stop the forest fire against the black smoke’s breath,
948 Buries the cattle killed by eating larkspur lush and blue,
949 Shoots the calf-thieves, lumber-thieves, and gets train-robbers too.

956 Governor and Sheriff obey his ordering hand,
957 Following his ostrich plume across the amber sand.
958 “But often, for lone days he goes, exploring cliffs afar,
959 And chants his King James’ Bible to tarantula and star.
960 I hear him read Egyptian tales, as he rides by in the dawn.
961 I am sometimes an Egyptian cat. My crudities are gone.
962 He spells, in Greek, that Homer, as he hurries on alone.
963 I hear him scan at Virgil, as I hide behind a stone.
964 “He had kept me fond of Hawthorne, and Thoreau, cold and wise.
965 The silvery waves of Walden Pond, gleam in a bobcat’s eyes.
966 He has taught us grateful beasts to sing, like Orpheus of old.
967 The Boston forest ranger brings back the Age of Gold.”

969 And then I contradicted him, in a manner firm and flat.

973 A BACK-BAY WHALE]
974 
975 “I have never heard, in the cultured Hub, of rowdy men like that.”
976 “So much the worse for Boston,” said the Rocky Mountain cat.
977 
978 [Sidenote:
979 
980 _Sing like the Mariposa to the stream that seeks the sea,
981 Speak like that flower,
982 With still,
983 Olympian jest,
984 And cuplike word
985 Filling the hour._]
986 
987 And the cat purred on, in his great dream, as one who
988 seeks the noblest ends:--
989 “Higher than the Back Bay whales, that spout and leap,
990 and bite their friends,
991 Higher than those Moby-Dicks, the Boston Lover’s trail ascends.
992 Higher than the Methodist, or Unitarian spire,
993 Beyond the range of any fence of bowlder or barbed wire,
994 Telling to each other what the Boston Boys have done,
995 The lodge-pole pines go towering to the timber-line and sun.
996 And their whisper stirs love’s fury in each pantherish girl-child,
997 Till she dresses like a columbine, or a bleeding heart gone wild.
998 Like a harebell, golden aster, bluebell, Indian arrow,
999 Blue jay, squirrel, meadow lark, loco, mountain sparrow.
1000 Mayflower, sagebrush, dying swan, they court in disarray.
1001 The masquerade, in Love’s hot name, is like a forest-play.
1002 And she is held in worship who adores the noblest boys.
1003 So miner-lovers bring her new amazing pets and toys.
1004 Mewing, prowling hunters bring her grizzlies in chains.
1005 Ranchers bring red apples through the silver rains.
1006 In the mountain of my beauty-sleep, when storm-flowers
1007 Are in bloom,
1008 The Boston of my beauty-sleep, when storm-flowers
1009 Are in bloom.
1010 There are just such naked waterfalls, as are roaring there below.
1011 For the springs of Boston Common are from priceless summer snow.
1012 Serene the wind-cleared Boston peaks, and there white rabbits run
1013 Like funny giant snowflakes, hopping in the sun.
1014 The ptarmigan will leap and fly and clutter through the drift
1015 And the baby ptarmigans ‘peep, peep,’ when the weasel eyelids lift.
1016 And where the pools are still and deep, dwarf willows see themselves,
1017 And the Boston Mariposas bend, like mirror-kissing elves.
1018 White is the gypsum cliff, and white the snowbird’s warm,
1019 deep-feathered home,
1020 White are the cottonwood and birch, white is the fountain-foam.
1021 
1022 “In the waterfalls from the sunburnt cliffs, the bold
1023 nymphs leap and shriek
1024 The wrath of the water makes them fight, its kisses make them weak.
1025 
1026 With shoulders hot with sunburn, with bodies rose and white,
1027 And streaming curls like sunrise rays, or curls like flags of night,
1028 Flowing to their dancing feet, circling them in storm,
1029 And their adorers glory in each lean, Ionic form.
1030 Oh, the hearts of women, then set free. They live the life of old
1031 That chickadees and bobcats sing, the famous Age of Gold....
1032 They sleep and star-gaze on the grass, their red-ore camp fires shine,
1033 Like heaps of unset rubies spilled on velvet superfine.
1034 And love of man and maid is when the granite weds the snow-white stream.
1035 The ranch house bursts with babies. In the wood-lot deep eyes gleam,
1036 Buffalo children, barking wolves, fuming cinnamon bears.
1037 Human mustangs kick the paint from the breakfast-table chairs.”
1038 
1039 And then I contradicted him, in a manner firm and flat.
1040 “I have never heard, in the modest Hub, of a stock ill-bred as that.”
1041 “So much the worse for Boston,” said the lecherous mountain-cat.
1042 
1043 And the cat continued with the dream, as the snow blew round in drifts.
1044 “The caves beneath the craggy sides of Boston hold tremendous gifts
1045 For many youths that enter there, and lift up every stone that lifts.
1046 They wander in, and wander on, finding all new things they can,
1047 Some forms of jade or chrysoprase, more rare than radium for man.
1048 And the burro trains, to fetch the loot, are jolly fool parades.
1049 The burros flap their ears and bray, and take the steepest grades.
1050 Or loaded with long mining-drills, and railroad rails,
1051 and boards for flumes,
1052 Up Beacon Hill with fossil bats, swine bones from geologic tombs,
1053 Or loaded with cliff-mummies of lost dwellers of the land.
1054 Explorers’ yells and bridle bells sound above the sand.
1055 
1056 “In the desert of my beauty-sleep, when rainflowers
1057 Will not bloom,
1058 In the Boston of my beauty-sleep, when storms
1059 Will not bloom,
1060 
1061 [Illustration: VACHEL LINDSAY 1922
1062 
1063 THE BAT]
1064 
1065 By Bunker Hill’s tall obelisk, till the August sun awakes,
1066 I brood and stalk blue shadows, and my mad heart breaks.
1067 Thoughts of a hunt unutterable ring the obelisk around.
1068 And a thousand glorious sphinxes spring, singing, from the ground.
1069 Very white young Salem witches ride them down the west.
1070 The gravel makes a flat, lone track, the eye has endless rest.
1071 Fair girls and beasts charge, dreaming, through the
1072 salt-sand white as snow,
1073 Hunting the three-toed pony, while mysterious slaughters flow.
1074 And the bat from the salt desert sucks the clouds on high
1075 Until they fall in ashes, and all the sky is dry.
1076 Oh, the empty Spanish Missions, where the bells ring without hand,
1077 As we drive the shadowy dinosaurs and mammoths through the sand.”
1078 
1079 And then I contradicted him, in a manner firm and flat.
1080 “I have never seen, in the sun-kissed Hub, circuses like that.”
1081 “So much the worse for you, my cub,” said the slant-eyed mountain-cat.
1082 
1083 And the cat continued with his yarn, while I stood there marveling:--
1084 “I here proclaim that I am not a vague, an abstract thing.
1085 I like to eat the turkey-leg, the lamb, the chickenwing.
1086 Yet the cat that knows not fasting, the cat that knows not dream,
1087 That has not drunk dim mammoth-blood from the long-dead desert stream,
1088 That has not rolled in the alkali-encrusted pits of bones
1089 By the saber-toothed white tiger’s cave, where he kicked
1090 the ancient stones,
1091 Has not known sacred Boston. Our gods are burning ore.
1092 Our Colorado gods are the stars of heaven’s floor.
1093 But the god of Massachusetts is a Tiger they adore.
1094 
1095 “From that saber-tooth’s ghost-purring goes the whispered word of power
1096 In the sunset, in the moonlight, in the purple sunrise hour:--
1097 That an Indian chief is born, in a teepee, to the west,
1098 That a school of rattlesnakes is rattling, on the mountain’s breast,
1099 That an opal has been grubbed from the ground by a mole,
1100 That a bumble-bee has found a new way to save his soul.
1101 In Egyptian granite Boston, the rumor has gone round
1102 That new ways to tame the whirlwind have been marvelously found.
1103 That a Balanced Rock has fallen, that a battle has been won
1104 In the soul of some young touch-me-not, some tigerish Emerson.”
1105 
1106 And then I contradicted him, in a manner firm and flat.
1107 “Boston people do not read their Emerson like that.”
1108 “So much the worse for Boston,” said the self-reliant cat.
1109 Then I saw the cat there towering, like a cat cut from a hill:--
1110 A prophet-beast of Nature’s law, staring with stony will,
1111 Pacing on the icy top, then stretched in drowsy thought,
1112 Then, listening, on tiptoe, to the voice the snowwind brought,
1113 Tearing at the fire-killed pine trees, kittenish again,
1114 Then speaking like a lion, long made president of men:--
1115 “There are such holy plains and streams, there are such
1116 sky-arched spaces,
1117 There are life-long trails for private lives, and endless
1118 whispering places.
1119 Range is so wide there is not room for lust and poison breath
1120 And flesh may walk in Eden, forgetting shame and death.”
1121 
1122 And then I contradicted him, in a manner firm and flat.
1123 “I have never heard, in Boston, of anything like that.”
1124 “_Boston is peculiar._
1125 _Boston is mysterious._
1126 _You do not know your Boston_,” said the wise, fastidious cat,
1127 And turned again to lick the skull of his prey, the mountain-rat!
1128 And at that, he broke off his wild dream of a perfect human race.
1129 And I walked down to the aspen grove where is neither time nor place,
1130 Nor measurement, nor space, except that grass has room
1131 And aspen leaves whisper on forever in their grace.
1132 All day they watch along the banks. All night the perfume goes
1133 From the Mariposa’s chalice to the marble mountain-rose,
1134 In the Boston of their beauty-sleep, when storm-flowers
1135 Are in bloom,
1136 In the mystery of their beauty-sleep, when storm-flowers
1137 Are in bloom.

1144 THE ROCKETS THAT REACHED SATURN
1145 
1146 
1147 On the Fourth of July sky rockets went up
1148 Over the church and the trees and the town,
1149 Stripes and stars, riding red cars.
1150 Each rocket wore a red-white-and-blue gown,
1151 And I did not see one rocket come down.
1152 
1153 Next day on the hill I found dead sticks,
1154 Scorched like blown-out candle-wicks.
1155 
1156 But where are the rockets? Up in the sky.
1157 As for the sticks, let them lie.
1158 Dead sticks are not the Fourth of July.
1159 
1160 In Saturn they grow like wonderful weeds,
1161 In some ways like weeds of ours,
1162 Twisted and beautiful, straight and awry,
1163 But nodding all day to the heavenly powers.
1164 The stalks are smoke,
1165 And the blossoms green light,
1166 And crystalline fireworks flowers.

1176 
1177 
1178 A spirit in soft slippers
1179 Walked the Gulf Stream floor.
1180 She opened many a cabin door
1181 Of ships a long time underseas.
1182 She read long-rest Egyptian books
1183 And looked upon skull-faces,

1185 Shining through the shadows

1202 Sometimes he is in my heart--
1203 Sometimes in the sea.
1204 Then tides are in my heart,
1205 And tides are in the sea.
1206 O traveler! abiding not
1207 Where he pretends to be!

1222 With Mary Pickford curls in clouds and whirls.)
1223 She was trying to think of something nice to say,
1224 So she pointed to a page by her fellow star and sage,
1225 And said: “I wish that _I_ could write that way!”

1237 Some balloons grow on trees,
1238 On rubber trees, indeed.
1239 You plant old rubber-boots for seed.
1240 
1241 Some balloons grow on trees.
1242 If you want them red,
1243 You pour red ink into the boots,
1244 There in the balloon bed,
1245 
1246 And blue ink if you want them blue.
1247 But if you desire them green,
1248 Just let it pass.
1249 They will turn green to match the grass.
1250 
1251 Some balloons grow on trees.
1252 And if you do not spray them soon
1253 With water-pots of hellebore
1254 You will not have
1255 One ripe balloon.
1256 Mosquitoes will bite them in the night
1257 Explode them like a thunder-storm
1258 And give the town a fright.

1267 The trees on which they grew

1296 A jumbo so vain, and fond of his shape
1297 Had himself beautified by a gray ape,

1300 Then the ape rode the jumbo
1301 And made the land gape,
1302 As he sat at his ease in the elephant chair.
1303 He had tattooed himself with designs from a shawl,
1304 And he gathered a grape with a self-possessed air,
1305 And threw down a twig at another fine ape.

1445 
1446 THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
1447 PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK
1448 
1449 To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
1450 distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
1451 (or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
1452 Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
1453 Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
1454 www.gutenberg.org/license.
1455 
1456 Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
1457 Gutenberg-tm electronic works
1458 
1459 1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
1460 electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
1461 and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
1462 (trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
1463 the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
1464 destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
1465 possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
1466 Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
1467 by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
1468 person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1469 1.E.8.
1470 
1471 1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
1472 used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
1473 agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
1474 things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
1475 even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
1476 paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
1477 Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
1478 agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
1479 electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
1480 
1481 1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
1482 Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
1483 of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
1484 works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
1485 States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
1486 United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
1487 claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
1488 displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
1489 all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
1490 that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
1491 free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
1492 works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
1493 Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
1494 comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
1495 same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
1496 you share it without charge with others.
1497 
1498 1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
1499 what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
1500 in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
1501 check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
1502 agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
1503 distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
1504 other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
1505 representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
1506 country outside the United States.
1507 
1508 1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:
1509 
1510 1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
1511 immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
1512 prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
1513 on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
1514 phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
1515 performed, viewed, copied or distributed:
1516 
1517 This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
1518 most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
1519 restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
1520 under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
1521 eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
1522 United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
1523 are located before using this ebook.
1524 
1525 1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
1526 derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
1527 contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
1528 copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
1529 the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
1530 redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
1531 Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
1532 either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
1533 obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
1534 trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.
1535 
1536 1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
1537 with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
1538 must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
1539 additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
1540 will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
1541 posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
1542 beginning of this work.
1543 
1544 1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
1545 License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
1546 work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.
1547 
1548 1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
1549 electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
1550 prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
1551 active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
1552 Gutenberg-tm License.
1553 
1554 1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
1555 compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
1556 any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
1557 to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
1558 other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
1559 version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
1560 (www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
1561 to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
1562 of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
1563 Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
1564 full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.
1565 
1566 1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
1567 performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
1568 unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.
1569 
1570 1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
1571 access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
1572 provided that
1573 
1574 * You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
1575 the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
1576 you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
1577 to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
1578 agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
1579 Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
1580 within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
1581 legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
1582 payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
1583 Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
1584 Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
1585 Literary Archive Foundation."
1586 
1587 * You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
1588 you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
1589 does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
1590 License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
1591 copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
1592 all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
1593 works.
1594 
1595 * You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
1596 any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
1597 electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
1598 receipt of the work.
1599 
1600 * You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
1601 distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.
1602 
1603 1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
1604 Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
1605 are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
1606 from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
1607 Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
1608 trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.
1609 
1610 1.F.
1611 
1612 1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
1613 effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
1614 works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
1615 Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
1616 electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
1617 contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
1618 or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
1619 intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
1620 other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
1621 cannot be read by your equipment.
1622 
1623 1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
1624 of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
1625 Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
1626 Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
1627 Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
1628 liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
1629 fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
1630 LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
1631 PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
1632 TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
1633 LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
1634 INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
1635 DAMAGE.
1636 
1637 1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
1638 defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
1639 receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
1640 written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
1641 received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
1642 with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
1643 with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
1644 lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
1645 or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
1646 opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
1647 the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
1648 without further opportunities to fix the problem.
1649 
1650 1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
1651 in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
1652 OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
1653 LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.
1654 
1655 1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
1656 warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
1657 damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
1658 violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
1659 agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
1660 limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
1661 unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
1662 remaining provisions.
1663 
1664 1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
1665 trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
1666 providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
1667 accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
1668 production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
1669 electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
1670 including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
1671 the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
1672 or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
1673 additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
1674 Defect you cause.
1675 
1676 Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm
1677 
1678 Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
1679 electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
1680 computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
1681 exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
1682 from people in all walks of life.
1683 
1684 Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
1685 assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
1686 goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
1687 remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
1688 Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
1689 and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
1690 generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
1691 Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

1720 Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
1721 Literary Archive Foundation
1722 
1723 Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
1724 spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
1725 increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
1726 freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
1727 array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
1728 ($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
1729 status with the IRS.
1730 
1731 The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
1732 charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
1733 States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
1734 considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
1735 with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
1736 where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
1737 DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
1738 state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate
1739 
1740 While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
1741 have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
1742 against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
1743 approach us with offers to donate.
1744 
1745 International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
1746 any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
1747 outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
1748 
1749 Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
1750 methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
1751 ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
1752 donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

1754 Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.
1755 
1756 Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
1757 Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
1758 freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
1759 distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
1760 volunteer support.
1761 
1762 Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
1763 editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
1764 the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
1765 necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
1766 edition.
1767 
1768 Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
1769 facility: www.gutenberg.org
1770 
1771 This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
1772 including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
1773 Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
1774 subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
